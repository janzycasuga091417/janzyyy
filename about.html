					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>Hi there! I am Jan Zy Casuga the owner of Fashionista Online Boutique  My website are with  passion to create  one of a kind shopping experience. I had a strong desire to create a site where women of all ages, shapes, sizes and budgets could find their dream outfit. Not just the perfect dress, but the shoes, earrings, and purse needed to make it the outfit of your dreams. I knew I wanted to create fashion that was obtainable to everyone, because I believe that a woman's outfit strongly impacts how they feel. Everyone deserves to feel beautiful, and that is what I sought to create</p>

				<h2>Evening Chic Style</h2>
				<h5>Fashionista Online Boutique| April 26, 2019  </h5>
				<p> Formal Night gets a modern luxury reboot. Say goodbye to Formal Night, and hello to Evening Chic. It’s your time to shine—your way. Get glamorous. Get chic. Be sophisticated. Now, on up to two nights on every cruise, Evening Chic activities have been introduced, and Evening Chic attire has replaced Formal attire. While dressier than Smart Casual, Evening Chic is intended to be less dressy than Formal attire. </p>
